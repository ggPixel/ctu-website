# Part Time Courses

Part Time courses are created by adding a new page. (Part Time courses will soon be a custom post type)
There are a couple of required custom fields.
[example course](https://ctutraining.ac.za/part-time-courses/google-courses/google-adwords-for-businesses/)

## Required Custom Fields

### Description

### Duration
`duration`

### Entry requirements
`entry_requirements`

### Assessment Link
`assessment`

[CTU's Assessment Portal](https://ctutraining.ac.za/assessments/) might have an assessment aligned to a course in which case you can add the direct link to the assessment. This will display a banner with the link.
